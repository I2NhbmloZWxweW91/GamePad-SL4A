# GamePad-SL4A
<br>

### Introduction
I wanted to check is it possible to control a PC game using an android device. So I created a prototype programme using SL4A which uses the accelometer and allow anyone to do whatever they want using X Y Z values. In here I'm going to use them for turning a wheel left-right and release gas and push break in a car game.

### Prerequisites 
 - Python interpreter in Android with standard libraries



### Setup
1. Set A D W S keys properly in your game
2. Make sure to connect both devices to a same network
3. Run sender.py in your Android
4. Change `HOST` in controller.py and run in PC


### Tested 
Tested with NFS Most Wanted
<br>

### To-Do
- Use two threads for turning wheel and GasAndBreak
- Much more suitable algorithmes will improve the handling.
